        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <p>1 serving</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>1 dl of grated pecorino/parmiggano/grana padano etc</li>
            <li>Lots of ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 pack of bacon (ca 140 g)</li>
            <li>1 medium sized onion</li>
            <li>125 g spagetti</li>
            <li>Optional: 1 fresh red chili</li>
        </ul>

        <H4>Steps</H4>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together the egg and egg yolk in a bowl. Save the egg white for your next day breakfast scrambled eggs, or give it to your dog</li>
            <li>Grate the cheese, and add it to the bowl</li>
            <li>Grind a lot of black pepper into the bowl, and whisk</li>
            <li>Chop up the onion and optional chili, and put to the side</li>
            <li>Chop up the bacon and add to a cold pan, put the heat on and let it warm up with the bacon in the pan</li>
            <li>Cook the pasta at the same time</li>
            <li>When bacon looks 90% done, add in your chopped onion and optional red chili</li>
            <li>When pasta is done, move it from the pot directly to your pan. Turn off heat and mix it with contents of the pan</li>
            <li>This is the tricky part. Have a pasta bowl ready. Pour the egg-mix onto the pasta and bacon in the pan and mix quickly. If too slow, you will get scrambled eggs. Pour it all in the pasta bowl</li>
            <li>Add more ground pepper if needed, as well as a bit more ground cheese</li>
            <li>Enjoy your <em>Pasta Carbonara รก la Juarez</em><sup>TM</sup></li>
        </ol>
